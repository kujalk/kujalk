## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! Iâ€™m Kugathasan Janarthanan (Jana) â€” a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) and Infrastructure Developer with over a decade of hands-on experience navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape.

From building scalable cloud architectures to automating complex workflows, my journey spans the realms of Software Development, DevOps, Cloud Automation, and Machine Learning. Iâ€™ve worn many hats over the yearsâ€”engineer, architect, mentor, problem-solverâ€”and every one of them reflects my passion for pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

I specialize in a powerful blend of tools and platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Python, and beyond. Whether Iâ€™m optimizing infrastructure, driving CI/CD pipelines, building backend systems with Golang, or even dabbling in embedded systems and Raspberry Pi, my mission remains the same: to innovate, streamline, and deliver.

By day, I work at a reputed multinational company. By night (and sometimes early morning!), I help clients as a freelancer, automating their cloud journeys across multiple platforms. And now, through this blog, Iâ€™m sharing my learnings, real-world solutions, and insightsâ€”straight from my terminal to yours.

Whether you're a fellow engineer, a curious learner, or just passing byâ€”I hope you find something valuable here. Letâ€™s grow together, one line of code at a time.
